#### Sunday, 7 Januray 2018
- Updated the camera's fly by mode to use Cubic BÃ©zier Curves.

#### Saturday, 6 Januray 2018
- Code now builds using VS2017
- Added a 64 bit build
- Increased font size in dialogs, which in turn required all dialogs to be re-laid out
- Replaced fixed sized buffer strings with std::string
- Replaced almost all sprintf_s code with std::ostringstream

#### Monday, 12 August 2002
- released demo version 1.10, it includes all the above bug fixes and a few more

#### Sunday, 11 August 2002
- the bug causing the game to crash at startup on a few select computers has been squished.

#### Saturday, 10 August 2002
- fixed some more cosmetic bugs with the UI
- fixed the 3D Sound wierdness
- added DirectShow code so the game will now play MP3s, although none are distributed in this zip

#### Friday, 9 August 2002
- fixed some cosmetic bugs with the UI
- made the difference between each bot personality larger eg. inept bots really are dumb now :)

#### Thursday, 8 August 2002
- fixed a bug causing the properties/auto defense dialog to reflect the wrong state of shields
- added more logging to hopefully catch why some video cards cause the game to crash during startup
- fixed a bug causing tanks from previous games to be placed on landscape

#### Monday, 5 August 2002
- released demo version 1.00

#### Ideas for Heavy Artillery 2

- put landscape deformation code back in
- make slider gui control and use it for sound and music volume
- make some sort of radar for the HUD
- rigid body physics
- network support, chat window etc
